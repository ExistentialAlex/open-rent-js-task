# Open Rent JS Task

This repo contains my solution to a coding task provided by Open Rent.

## Task Description

Given a string input, write a function that will return a string made up of the following concatenated:

- the reverse of the input string
- the earliest character in the alphabet present in the input string (making a reasonable assumption as to what "earliest" means).
- count the number of vowels in the input string and append "open" if that number is odd, and "rent" if that number is even.

For example:

Input: nepo
Output: openerent
